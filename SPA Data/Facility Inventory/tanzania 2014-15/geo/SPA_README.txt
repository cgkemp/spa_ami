The facility coordinates in this SPA GPS dataset represent the true location of the facility and are NOT displaced.
The coordinates may not align precisely with GIS data from other sources due to generalization of administrative boundaries
or slight discrepancies between shapefiles.

NOTE: Some facilities are outside of SSIB borders but within the national borders and in the correct location.

SPAID = DHSCC&"SPA"&SPAYEAR&SPAFACID (with 8 digits) from survey documentation

DHSCC = 2 letter DHS country code (http://www.measuredhs.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm)

FIPSCC = Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 2 letter country code (http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip10-4.htm)

SPAYEAR = 4 digit year of data collection from the survey documentation

SPAFACID = integer cluster identification number

ADM1CODE = first sub-national administrative division code when sampling is representative at the Admin 1 level.  

ADM1NAME = first sub-national administrative division name when sampling is representative at the Admin 1 level. 

SPAREGCO = integer region code associated with the SPA region created for sampling.   

SPAREGNA = name associated with the SPA region created for sampling.  

SPATYPEC = facility type code as classified in the survey data file

SPATYPEN = facility type name as classified in the survey data file

SPAMANGC = facility managing organization code as classified in the survey data file

SPAMANGN = facility managing organization name as classified in the survey data file

SOURCE = source of data used to determine the latitude and longitude values
“GPS” for data collected by the survey team
"MFL" for Master Facility List or preexisting data provided by the government
“GAZ” for data extracted from a gazetteer of village/place names
"MIS" for clusters in which data could not be fully verified

LATNUM = facility's latitude coordinate in decimal degrees

LONGNUM = facility's longitude coordinate in decimal degrees

DATUM = "WGS84" for the geographic coordinate system World Geodetic System (WGS) 1984
